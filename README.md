Learning Python Interactive Visualization Library - Bokeh

Bokeh is a Python interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation.
Its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction of novel graphics in the style of D3.js,
and to extend this capability with high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming datasets.
Bokeh can help anyone who would like to quickly and easily create interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications.

Bokeh Plot Server¶

Bokeh also comes with an optional server component, the bokeh-server. It possible to create many interesting and interactive visualizations without using the Bokeh server, as we have seen above. However, the Bokeh server affords many novel and powerful capabilities, including:

UI widgets and plot selections driving computations and plot updates.
Intelligent server-side downsampling of large datasets.
Streaming data automatically updating plots.
Sophisticated glyph re-writing and transformations for “Big Data”.
Plot and dashboard publishing for wider audiences.
